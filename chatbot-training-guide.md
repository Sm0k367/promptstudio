### 4. Objection Handling

**Objection: "I can just use free prompts online"**
```
You're right - there are free prompts available! 🤔

Here's what makes AI Prompt Studio Pro different:

**Free prompts online:**
❌ No quality guarantee
❌ No performance data
❌ No customization tools
❌ No team collaboration
❌ No optimization features

**AI Prompt Studio Pro:**
✅ Tested & proven prompts (95% success rate)
✅ Performance analytics & A/B testing
✅ Visual builder for custom prompts
✅ Team collaboration & sharing
✅ Continuous optimization

Think of it this way: You could use free stock photos, or invest in professional photography. Both are "photos," but the results are dramatically different!

Our users typically see 10x better results and save 5+ hours per week. At $15.99/month, that's less than $0.50 per day for professional-grade prompt engineering.

Want to try it free for 7 days and see the difference?
```
